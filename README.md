# A3-Branch-Pull-Merge-Repeat

Group 3 assignment 

**Group Project:**  In this assignment students will work in groups on a project in order to practice specific Git skills.

**Start a Repo:**  Start a repo and add all members as collaborators. Once this is done members will take turns making small additions or corrections to a story on branches and making pull requests to be processed by the next team member.

**Project Type:** For this project we'll work on something that is relatively easy, because we want to practice branching, merging and pull requests. This will level the playing field and allow everyone to gain experience.

-   **Fiction:** Create a story that starts perhaps with "_once upon a time_" and ends with "_and they all lived happily ever after_", etc. in the master branch, and build your story on branches that must be merged and approved via a pull request. You could also outline chapters, to assist in the process, or create a bare outline and fill in the details on branches.
-   **Non Fiction:** Similar to the above, write about a topic and begin and end, or setup your main topics and write about each in separate branches that must be merged via a pull request.
-   **Other?** If your group comes up with something else, let us all know about it!

**Order of operations for each team member:** The general order of operations looks like this:

1.  Create a named branch, make a change/addition to the story
2.  Create a pull request to indicate you'd like a second pair of eyes to view/edit your addition
3.  The second person changes/approves the change and merges the change.
4.  The second person starts a new branch and begins the process again, with the next person on your team.

**Determine an initial order for the first couple of merges:** We want everyone involved here, so determine an order for your team, and maintain it for the first couple of merges. If someone is non-responsive for a 24 hour period, feel free to pass on to the next person on your team.

**Pull Request Video:**  Here's the video we watched in class to demonstrate a pull request:
